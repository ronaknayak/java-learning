 * INTRODUCTION:
 * 
 * Java8 Features:
 * ****************************************************************************
 * 1.Lambda expression
 * 
 * 2.Functional interface (Used to call Lambda expression)
 * 
 * 3.Default methods in interface
 * 
 * 4.Static methods in interface
 * 
 * 5.Predefined functional interface (Predicate, Function, Consumer, Supplier 
 * interfaces can be used in Lambda expression)
 * 
 * 6. :: operator (Used for method reference and constructor reference)
 * 
 * 7.Stream API (Used to perform bulk operations on collections)
 * 
 * 8.Date and Time API (joda.org API)
 * 
 * 
 * Why Java8 ?:
 * ****************************************************************************
 * 1.To simplify programming. We can achieve our requirement by writing very less code.
 * 
 * 2.To utilize functional programming benefits in Java. We can take benefits of 
 * functional programming using lambda expressions.
 * 
 * 3.To enable parallel processing so that java can run on multI-core processor
 * efficiently.
 * 
 * 
 * Advantages of Lambda expression ?
 * ****************************************************************************
 * 1.To enable functional programming in java which in turn let us to Write more
 * readable, maintainable and concise(clean) code.
 * So now it has became possible to pass function or procedure as argument.
 * 
 * 2.We can reduce length of the code so that readability will be improved
 * 
 * 3.We can handle functions just like values
 * 
 * 4.We can pass functions as arguments
 * 
 * 5.To use APIs very easily and effectively
 * 
 * 6.To enable parallel processing so that java can run on multI-core processor
 * efficiently
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * > In OOP when we pass an object to the method that doesn't mean we pass
 * behavior but we are passing thing which has behavior. E.g. passing an object
 * of implementation class of an interface.
 * 
 * But, in Lambda expression we pass action i.e.behavior. This way it let us
 * just to create a function and which doesn't belong to any class.
 * 
 * > Lambda expression can be treated as function as values.
