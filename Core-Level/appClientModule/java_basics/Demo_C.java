/**RESERVED WORDS:
 * 
 * -> In java some words are reserved to represent some meaning or functionality.
 * such type of words are called reserved words.
 * 
 * -> there are 53 reserved words in java.
 * 
 * -> those are,
 * reserved literals: true, false and null(DEFAULT value for object reference).
 * 
 * keywords: 
 * for data types,
 * byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char
 * 
 * for flow controls,
 * if, else, switch, case, default, do, while, for, break, return, continue
 * 
 * for modifiers,
 * public, private, protected, static, final, abstract, synchronized, native, strictfp, transient, volatile
 * 
 * for exception handling,
 * try, catch, finally, throw, throws, assert
 * 
 * for class related keywords,
 * class, interface, extends, implements, package, import
 * 
 * for object related keywords,
 * new, instanceof, super, this
 * 
 * for return type keyword,
 * void (In java return type is mandatory, there is no default return type.)
 * 
 * unused keyword,
 * goto (sun people banned this keyword in java.), const (use final instead of const.)
 * both are unused keywords and if we are trying to use we'll get compile time error.
 * 
 * for user defined data type,
 * enum (we can use to define group of named constants.)
 * 
 * 
 * conclusions:
 * 
 * -> All reserved words in java contains only lower case alphabet symbols.
 * 
 * -> In java we have only new key word and there is no delete keyword because destruction of useless objects is 
 * the responsibility of garbage collector.
 * 
 * -> The following are new keywords in java,
 * strictfp, assert and enum.
