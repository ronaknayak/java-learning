/**
 * Customized Serialization:
 * 
 * Need of Customized Serialization: In default Serialization there may be
 * chance of loss of information because of TRANSIENT keyword.
 * 
 * In Serialization, at sender side & receiver side if we do some extra work
 * then we can able to recover loss of information. This extra work is nothing
 * but Customized Serialization.
 * 
 * 
 * We can implement Customized Serialization by using the following two methods
 * in corresponding class:
 * 
 * private void writeObject(ObjectOutputStream o) throws Exception
 * 
 * This method will be executed automatically at the time of serialization &
 * it's a call back method i.e. automatically called by JVM.
 * 
 * Hence, while performing serialization if we want to do any extra work we have
 * to write corresponding code in this method only.
 * 
 * private void readObject(ObjectInputStream o) throws Exception
 * 
 * This method will be executed automatically at the time of DeSerialization &
 * it's a call back method.
 * 
 * Hence, while performing DeSerialization if we want to do any extra work we
 * have to write corresponding code in this method only.
 * 
 * As this methods called by JVM automatically, syntax must be like this.
