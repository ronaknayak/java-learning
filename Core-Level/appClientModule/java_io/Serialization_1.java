/**
 * Serialization:
 * 
 * It is the process to convert normal object from Java supported form to a File
 * supported form or Network supported form. This conversion process is called
 * serialization. i.e. It's a mechanism of writing the state of an object into a
 * byte stream.
 * 
 * The process of converting object from File supported form or Network
 * supported form to Java supported form is called DeSerialization.
 * 
 * 
 * We can perform serialization only for serializable objects. An object is said
 * to be serializable if the corresponding class implements Serializable
 * interface. So, It must be implemented by the class whose object you want to
 * persist.
 * 
 * Serializable interface present in java.io package and does not contain any
 * method, it is a marker interface.
 * 
 * If we are trying to serialize a non-Serializable object we'll get RE:
 * NotSerializableException.
 * 
 * It is mainly used to travel object's state on the network.
 * 
 * ObjectOutputStream(c):
 * 
 * The Java ObjectOutputStream class (java.io.ObjectOutputStream) enables you to
 * write Java objects to an OutputStream instead of just raw bytes. You wrap an
 * OutputStream in a ObjectOutputStream and then you can write objects to it.
 * 
 * ObjectInputStream(c):
 * 
 * The Java ObjectInputStream class (java.io.ObjectInputStream) enables you to
 * read Java objects from an InputStream instead of just raw bytes. You wrap an
 * InputStream in a ObjectInputStream and then you can read objects from it.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * transient keyword:
 * 
 * At the time of serialization if we don't want to serialize the value of a
 * particular variable to meet the security constraint, we have to declare these
 * variable with transient keyword.
 * 
 * At the time of serialization, JVM ignores original value of transient
 * variable and saves default value.
 * 
 * 
 * transient VS static:
 * 
 * static variables are not part of object. Hence, they won't participate in
 * serialization process. Due to this, declaring static variable as transient
 * there is no impact.
 * 
 * transient VS final:
 * 
 * final variables will be participate in serialization directly by their
 * values. Hence, declaring final variable with transient there is no impact.
 * 
 * 
 * Note(ENTHUWARE):
 * 
 * Remember that transient fields and static fields are never serialized.
 * Constructor, instance blocks, and field initialization of the class being
 * DeSerialized are also not invoked. i.e. During DeSerialization, the
 * constructor of the class (or any static or instance blocks) is not executed.
